## Overview

This project analyses origin-destination migration flow data from Kazakhstan's Bureau of National Statistics, covering 3,039 migration corridors across 20 regions over 8 years. The analysis reveals the dominant urban pull of Astana, Almaty, and Shymkent — and the persistent population loss in northern and eastern oblasts.

## Key findings

- Only **3 of 20 regions** consistently gain population from internal migration: Astana, Almaty city, and Shymkent
- The **Almaty → Almaty city** corridor is the single largest migration flow in 2025 (36,729 people)
- **Northern oblasts** (North Kazakhstan, East Kazakhstan, Kostanay) are the fastest-depopulating regions
- Internal migration volumes have **increased significantly since 2020**, with 2025 showing the highest recorded flows
- **Almaty region** emerged as a net gainer in 2024 — a new suburbanisation signal around Almaty city
